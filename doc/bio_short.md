Number of AUs attended

Jeremy first attended AU 2007, where he presented five sessions on the Revit API.

Sessions at this year's AU

I will be presenting three sessions on the Revit API this year, as well as attending the AEC API experts panel discussion. Two of the sessions are repeats from last year, 'The Revit SDK Sample Smörgåsbord' and 'Enhancing Your Revit Add-In', both of which were very well received. The sample application I wrote to manage and demonstrate the Revit SDK samples in the Smörgåsbord session has since been integrated into the official standard Revit SDK for worldwide distribution, which is very gratifying. The third session is 'The Ins and Outs of Revit MEP Programming', new for this year's AU, on the exciting possibilities provided by the MEP-specific API, available for the first time for Revit MEP 2009. I'm looking forward very much to the 'AEC API Talk' panel session, where I get to hear more about and discuss developers real serious top priority interests and concerns.

Most memorable Autodesk conference moment

Emile Kfouri saying he wanted to avoid doing a 'Jim Quanci' during one of his DevDays presentations, referring to some slip of tongue of Jim's.

Favourite part of AU

Definitely meeting with customers and developers at these events and discussing current trends, challenges and solutions! Also, re-connecting with other Autodesk employees, especially my closest ADN workgroup team members, since we are so widely dispersed - world-wide, we could impossibly be further apart - in spite of working together extremely closely on a daily basis. I regret not having more time and being able to attend more sessions! A clone or two would be handy ...
