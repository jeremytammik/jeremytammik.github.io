<h3>Mathematics und Physics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pure mathematics</li>
<li>Probability theory and statistics</li>
<li>Numerical analysis</li>
<li>Theoretical physics</li>
</ul>

<p>I studied mathematics and physics between 1978 and 1984 at the
Philipps-Universit&auml;t Marburg an der Lahn. I finished my studies with an M.S. diploma.
The overall grade and all sub grades were the highest possible, "sehr gut".</p>

<p>As is common, I began my studies in pure mathematics: 
algebra, function theory, linear algebra, differential and integral analysis. 
After the intermediate diploma I continued my studies in pure mathematics with 
functional analysis, spectral theory, and homology theory, but also turned more 
and more toward applied mathematics, beginning with probability theory and statistics
with Prof. Mammitzsch, then numerical analysis with Prof. B&ouml;hmer.</p>

<p>In collaboration with Prof. B&ouml;hmer I led various tutorials on numerical analysis
and the programming languages Pascal and Basic.</p>

<p>I wrote my M.S. thesis on "error asymtotik and defect correction
for the solution of stiff differential equations" under Prof. B&ouml;hmer's leadership, 
in Fortran on the university mainframe computer.</p>

<p>In physics, I was mainly interested in theoretical subjects, especially
electrodynamics and quantum mechanics.</p>
